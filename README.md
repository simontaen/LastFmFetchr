LastFmFetchr
============

A lightweight JSON-based Objective-C wrapper to make asynchronous requests for the [Last.fm API](http://www.last.fm/api).

**Note:** You will need to [create an API Account](http://www.last.fm/api/account/create) to get an API key which must be set when you first instantiate LastFmFetchr, otherwise an exception will be thrown.

## Quick Examples ##

The code base comes with a simple example showing how to use all of the different options available through the API request
